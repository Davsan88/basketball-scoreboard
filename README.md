# 🏀 JavaScript Scoreboard App

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple but polished basketball scoreboard built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

👉 [Live Demo](https://miamivicescoreboard.netlify.app/)

It was originally created as a foundational JavaScript exercise, but I decided to take it a step further — adding dynamic interactivity, custom fonts, persistent state with `localStorage`, and a reset feature.

Whether you're learning JavaScript or just love hoops, this is a fun and practical project to explore DOM manipulation and event-driven logic.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Lets users increase scores for two teams (HEAT and GUEST)
- ✅ Scores update instantly on the UI
- ✅ Saves scores to `localStorage` so they persist across page reloads
- ✅ Includes a "Reset" button to clear all scores and storage
- ✅ Custom fonts and styles to give it a cool retro Miami Heat vibe

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the page
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout (with a touch of flair)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage

---

## 📚 Features Covered

- DOM Selection with `querySelector`, `getElementById`
- Event Handling with `addEventListener`
- Custom data attributes (`data-*`) for DRY and scalable code
- Type conversion with `parseInt`
- JSON handling with `localStorage`
- Defensive programming (e.g. avoiding `NaN`)
- Minimal, responsive CSS layout with Flexbox
- Reset logic to clear state and storage

---

## 💡 Skills Practiced

- **Vanilla JS logic**: click events, loops, conditionals
- **Clean code patterns**: e.g. DRY with reusable listeners
- **LocalStorage**: persisting app state between sessions
- **Debugging**: tracing issues like `NaN`, console logging
- **Refactoring**: going beyond the course brief to make it feel production-ready

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Click the buttons under each team to increase the score by 1, 2, or 3 points.
3. Refresh the page — scores stay the same!
4. Click the "RESET" button to start a new game.

## 🏗️ Possible Next Steps

This scoreboard is a solid MVP (Minimum Viable Product), but there’s room to grow:

- ⏱ Add a game timer
- 🎯 Include a fouls counter
- 🧮 Track score history (previous quarters)
- 📱 Make it mobile-first and fully responsive
- 💾 Add audio/visual effects for score changes

## ✅ Why I'm Proud

This project started from a basic one-button score counter and evolved into a fully interactive, stateful mini-app. I pushed beyond the course brief to create something more dynamic and visually engaging, while reinforcing real-world development practices. I'm happy with what I’ve learned and built!
